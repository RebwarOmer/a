##-Nmap Scan Types
1. Ping Scan (-sP): to only know whether the target is alive or not.
Ex: nmap –sP 192.168.1.10
2. TCP SYN Scan (-sS): it uses to scan the services which are run on the target.
Ex: nmap –sS 192.168.1.10
3. Version Detection Scan (-sV): to know the versions of the services of the target.
Ex: nmap –sS sV 192.168.1.10
4. Protocol Scan (-O): to know the protocols, which are supported on the target.
Ex: nmap –O 192.168.1.10
5. ACK Scan (-sA): to know if the target is protected by a firewall or not, (filtered or unfiltered). 
Ex: nmap –sA 192.168.1.109
6. Firewall Scan 2 (-PN): to scan a target which is protected by the firewall.
Ex: nmap –PN 192.168.1.109
7. Open Ports Scan (- - open): to scan and show only the open ports of the target.
Ex: nmap - - open 192.168.1.109
8. Idle Scan (-sI): in this scan, Nmap doesn’t send the packets from your real IP address.
It uses another machine to send the packets.
Ex: nmap –sI 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.9
9. Scan specific ports:
Ex: nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.10
Ex: nmap -p 1-1000 www.google.com
10. TCP connect scan:
Ex: nmap -sT 192.168.1.2
11. UDP scan:
Ex: -sU 192.168.1.2
---------------------------

##-Timing and performance
1. Timing template (0–5; 5 fastest)
Ex: nmap-T4 192.168.1.1
→ -T0 very slow/stealthy, -T5 fastest (noisy).
2. Reduce retries / speed up
Ex: nmap --min-rate 1000 192.168.1.1
→ Force a minimum packet rate (use carefully).
---------------------------
##-Traceroute & network mapping
1. Perform traceroute to targets
Ex: nmap --traceroute 192.168.1.1
→ Shows path hops along with scan.
---------------------------

##-Full Scan
1. UDP + TCP full scan (slow, thorough):
nmap -sS -sU -p-www.facebook.com
→ scans all 65535 ports.
